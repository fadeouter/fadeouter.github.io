# Why Slides?
##### Here are some reasons why you can use this service:

# ⏱ 
##### Speed
Create a simple deck in 5 minutes. Slides made with speed in mind.

# 🙅 
##### Easy Design
You don't need to think about design; the layout generates automatically but is under your control.

# 📃 
##### One-Pager
Create an easy 16×9 one-pager. You can download particular slides in PNG.

# How to use it?

## 1
Slides use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) language. 

A new **slide** starts with `---`. 

A new **title** starts with symbols from `#` to `####` before the text. 

Slide content automatically divides into **blocks** depending on the number of titles.

## 2
You can place images, format text, and generate QR codes. 

Slides use Marked.js, which means you can freely use <strong style="color:yellow; background-color:green">HTML</strong> code.

# Use of Pictures

## How to embed an image

If there is only one picture, it appears in the center of a slide. Otherwise, it appears in a block alongside the text. 

You can't upload images into Slides; you can only embed existing URLs. 

Please note that Slides cannot export every image in PDF/PNG, depending on the source. We recommend using [Imgur](https://imgur.com) for image hosting.

# Principles

# 🌿 Low-Tech
Slides are based on a "low-tech development" concept: a programming approach that does not rely on external servers and has the lowest environmental impact possible.

# 😎 Privacy
There are no trackers from Google and other tech giants, only private analytics by the developer. The text of the slides is saved only on your machine.
